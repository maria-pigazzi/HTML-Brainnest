  <h1>Tango dancing</h1>
  <p>
    I always loved it even though it's considered a dance for old people both in Italy and Germany &#128549.
    <br>
    It was "invented" in Argentina around the start of the 20th century, but the basics were inspired by italian ballroom dances
    <br>
    and other mediterranean folk dances that immigrants had brought to the Americas.
    <br>
    If you wish you can dance it slowly and carefully, and that's why I
    prefer tango to other latin dances such as salsa or bachata.
