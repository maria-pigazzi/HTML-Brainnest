  <h1>Book reading</h1>
  <h2>Literature</h2>
    <p>I love classic literature. Anything almost from the 19th and 20th centuries works for me! At the moment I'm reading "La maladie de Sachs" by Winckler.
      I like, if I can, to read the books in their original language.
      <br>
      When they are translated there is always the risk that something that the author wanted
      to express will not be conveyed (especially wordplay is very difficult to translate).</p>

  <h2>Bookclubs</h2>
    <p>I am part of a bookclub here in Munich. We read a book every month and then discuss it in front of a nice warm drink!</p>
